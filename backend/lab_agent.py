        Act as a Tech Lead and Mentor.

        Group them into 3 distinct difficulty levels: "Easy", "Medium", and "Hard/Tough".
        Provide exactly 3 projects for EACH category.

        For each project, provide:
        - A unique 'id' (kebab-case string)
        - 'title': Project Name
        - 'description': Brief description
        - 'tech' list (e.g. ["React", "Python"])

        - 'difficulty': "Easy", "Medium", or "Hard"
